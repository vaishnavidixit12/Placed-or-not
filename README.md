# Placed or Not - LGTMB 

Welcome to my Kaggle notebook **"Placed or Not - LGTMB"**, where I dive into a student placement prediction problem using machine learning techniques. The goal is to determine whether a student will be placed based on academic and personal attributes.

## Problem Statement

The task is to build a predictive model that can determine the placement status (`Placed` or `Not Placed`) of a student using features such as academic scores, degree type, work experience, and more.

##  Dataset

The dataset used is from Kaggle: **Engineering Placements Prediction**. It includes fields like:

- Secondary and higher secondary percentage
- Degree and specialization
- Work experience
- Employability test scores
- Placement status (target)

## Approach

Here's how I structured the notebook:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions and correlations
- Checked for imbalances and outliers

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Normalized numerical features

### 3. Model Building
- Tried out multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Compared their performance

###  4. Evaluation
- Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Analyzed confusion matrix
- Selected the best-performing model

## Results

The final model gave promising results and could serve as a starting point for real-world student placement prediction systems.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## How to Use

1. Open the [notebook on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vaishnavidixit12/placed-or-not-lgtmb).
